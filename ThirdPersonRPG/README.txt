Path to scene to be Marked (there is only one scene)
Assets\Scenes\MarkThisScene

Used the following tutorial for the UI scalability

I made a custom StateMachine for the player, this was a paid for instruction to get the basics of Statemachines
I then used it to create my statemachine.

I applied the logic in a more simplified version of the above used from class and kind of a blend of the two for the enemy AIs

I have done the animation in 3d before very briefly so that one was one me (some of them might be jenky in which I appologize for)

Thanks for all the help on this Sean I hope this one is at least more fun to mark than my previous ones. Have an awesome break.

Note to the Marker, the objective is to collect all the items, there is one item thats outside of plaijn sight towards the forest
Engaging in combat will create more items that will have to be collected.

enjoy the "game",
